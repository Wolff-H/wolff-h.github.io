Candidate solutions play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions.\\r\\n## Concepts\\r\\n- Experiment  \\r\\n    An experiment consists of a number of trials, where each trial is an independant evolution. An experiment is to come up with a suitable solution.\\r\\n- Evolution  \\r\\n    An evolution is a sequence of generations. It will finally converges.\\r\\n- Generation  \\r\\n    Fitness distribution of a generation.\\r\\n- Individual  \\r\\n    The individual gene (characteristic combination/solution).\\r\\n## Usage\\r\\n1. Select experiment instance and algorithm.\\r\\n2. Manipulate dashboard to alter parameters for figures.\\r\\n3. Statistics for graphs are shown in dashboard.\\r\\n## Datasets\\r\\nThe city map datasets those we've run experiments.\\r\\n- WesternSahara (29 cities)\\r\\n- Uruguay (734 cities)\\r\\n- Canada (4663 cities)\\r\\nIt's imited by the size of solution file size to use datasets in the GUI, thus only WesternSahara one is presented.

given in class for an algorithm and I implemented the algorithms in code from scratch.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A-star Pathfinding\\r\\n\\r\\n    A-star (A*) is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency, it's widely used in computer science. The visualization app provides 10 different maps and plenty options for search operation.\\r\\n    For optimization, I store a preprocessed sector map before the search starts, therefore my code runs ten times faster than the solution algorithm. However it can still take some time to run the preprocessing before you enter a new map.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. JPS Pathfinding\\r\\n\\r\\n    Jump point search (JPS) is an optimization to the A* search algorithm for uniform-cost grids. It reduces symmetries in the search procedure by means of graph pruning, eliminating certain nodes in the grid based on assumptions.\\r\\n    This work inherits the framework from A-star's.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Alpha-Beta Method\\r\\n\\r\\n    Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.\\r\\n    Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore will be posted as I set them up...\";","\r\n    import {
